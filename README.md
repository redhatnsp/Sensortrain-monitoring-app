# Sensortrain-monitoring-App

Sensortrain-monitoring-App is a module in a larger system that is responsible for displaying the sensor data and allowing the train to stop and start

## How it works

Sensortrain-monitoring-app receives sensor data over JSON and it displays it on the page.  The page allows for start and stop of the train using the buttons.

## Prerequisites

- **Kafka**: Sensortrain-monitoring-App uses Kafka to receive data from the Train-CEQ-App module. You need to have a Kafka cluster running and accessible to Sensortrain-monitoring-App. The Kafka cluster's URL should be specified in the `kafka.bootstrap.servers` property in the `application.properties` file.

## Dependencies

Sensortrain-monitoring-App has the following dependencies:

- **Quarkus**: A Kubernetes-native Java stack tailored for GraalVM and OpenJDK HotSpot.
- **Apache Kafka Client**: A client library for Apache Kafka.
- **CloudEvents SDK**: A Java SDK for CloudEvents.

These dependencies are managed by Maven and are specified in the `pom.xml` file.

## Related Modules

Sensortrain-monitoring-App is part of a larger system that includes the following modules:

- **Capture-App**: This module captures video and sends it to Intelligent-Train.
- **Intelligent-Train**: This module uses machine learning algorithms to make decisions based on the data received from the Capture-App.
- **Train-CEQ-App**: This module processes the raw predictions made by the Intelligent-Train module, transforming them into actionable insights.
- **Train-Controller**: This module receives decisions from Train-CEQ-App and controls the operation of the train accordingly.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Demo-AI-Edge-Crazy-Train/train-monitoring-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd monitoring-app`
3. Update the `application.properties` file with the appropriate values.
4. Run the application: `./mvnw clean quarkus:dev`
5. Go to http://localhost:8086
